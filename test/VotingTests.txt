Testing for Voting

- start Voting with Yes / No and with multiple options
- let people Vote with tokens
-- Once with all tokens on one options
-- Once splitting the votes within multiple options
--> Remember to give the Voting Contract address the approval to be able to create the transfer, 
    the voting will not work, because the **Contract address** is the address that is requesting
    the transfer in the Coin contract, not the msg.sender in this case

- finish the Vote and give out the respective result
--> Remember again to give the voting contract the approval to send all tokens back from the Owner
    contract. 

(- maybe create a version where the owner is approving the contract to send enough tokens, but the owner
   does not have the tokens in their account any more and see what would happen then [finishing the vote
   should not be able in that case])
